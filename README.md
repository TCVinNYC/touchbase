# TouchBase - Let's Reconnect

Developed with Flutter and uses Firestore as NoSQL database & authentication for the entire app.
Wrote clean, maintainable, and well-tested code using Dart and MVC to provide a highly functional and performant app on iOS and
Android devices. Utilized Flutter dependencies and widgets to deploy TouchBase to TestFlight in under a month. Researched best practice database schemas for social media applications when using Firebase Firestore, for offline data retention and
high-speed online data sync.
